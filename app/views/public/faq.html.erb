<h4>How do I add my swimmers?</h4>
<p>
  You must be an admin monitor to add or edit swimmer information. Visit the SWIMMERS page under your account. From there, you can click ADD SWIMMER to add swimmers one-at-a-time. Alternatively, you can click IMPORT SWIMMERS to upload a spreadsheet of swimmer information to create them in bulk.
</p>
<br>

<h4>What if I canâ€™t find a swimmer?</h4>
<p>
  Please verify correct spelling in searching by the LAST NAME of a swimmer. If a new swimmer needs to be added to the database an admin can add one or multiple swimmers to the
  database on the Swimmers page.
</p>
<br>

<h4>Why do swimmers need a phone number to be checked in?</h4>
<p>
  Swimmers need a valid ten-digit phone number stored in order to be checked in for safety reasons. If for some reason not all swimmers are accounted for at the end of a session
  you can simply click CALL on the CHECK OUT page to call the swimmer directly and make sure they have exited the water safely. This usually happens because a swimmer did not
  get checked out properly at the end of their swim.
